In this diagram:

    The "Secure API Server" represents the main component of the system, running the Flask application that implements the API server logic.
    The "Reverse Proxy" is an optional component that can sit between the API server and the clients. It can handle SSL/TLS termination and load balancing.
    The "Clients" represent the users or applications that interact with the API server by making HTTP requests.

Please note that this is a simplified representation, and the actual architectural diagram for your project may include more components, such as databases, external services, or additional layers.
