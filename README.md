# SecureAPIServer.py
Secure API Server

This is a Python script that implements a secure API server using the Flask framework. It provides basic authentication, rate limiting, SSL encryption, and various security features to protect the API endpoints.
Features

    HTTP Basic Authentication: The API server requires clients to provide a username and password to access protected endpoints.
    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Certain endpoints can be restricted to specific user roles, allowing for fine-grained access control.
    Request Validation: Incoming requests are validated against a predefined JSON schema to ensure data integrity and prevent malformed or invalid requests.
    Content-Type Checking: Strict checking of the Content-Type header is enforced to verify that the request payload matches the expected content type.
    API Key Authentication: API key-based authentication is supported, where clients include an API key as part of the request headers.
    Error Handling and Responses: Consistent error messages, status codes, and error logging are implemented to enhance the overall user experience.
    Rate Limiting: The API server limits the number of requests per minute for each client to prevent abuse or excessive usage.
    SSL Encryption: HTTPS/TLS encryption is enforced to secure the communication between the API server and clients.

Setup and Configuration

    Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Configure the JWT secret key in the app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] variable in the script.
    Customize the authentication logic in the check_auth function according to your specific requirements.
    Define the RBAC logic in the has_role function based on your desired role-based access control.
    Modify the JSON schema in the request_schema variable to match the expected request payload for request validation.
    Run the script using python secure_api_server.py.
    The API server will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Endpoints

    GET /api/protected: A protected endpoint that requires authentication. Users with the 'admin' role can access this endpoint.
    GET /api/unprotected: An unprotected endpoint that does not require authentication.
